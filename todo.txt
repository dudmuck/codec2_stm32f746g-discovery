1) call svc_uart() at while (c2 == NULL) loop main() in lora_transceiver/Src/main.c for the purpose of selected codec2 rate from UART, which would be selected by a character '0' for 3200, up to 'n' for 700C.   svc_uart() is in lora_xcvr.c
2) add to svc_uart() a character to reset the MCU via nvic-reset.  This is to permit operating with a different codec2 rate.
3) at AudioLoopback_demo() in the while(1) loop, the user button is read.  When user button is pressed, TX starts and TX ends when user button is released.  Add a character to svc_uart() to start TX and another to end TX.
4) for the purpose of testing that encoded codec2 frames are correctly sent over radio link (and received), we want to add a test mode to transmit a sequence number instead of frames encoded by decmiated_encode(), then on receiver detect these frames with sequence number instead of decoded with codec2_decode(), the sequence number received would be tracked to detect dropped frames or duplicate frames.
5) create a shell script to run this sequence test on all codec2 rates.  and save log files of failed test. The two boards are available on /dev/ttyACM1 and /dev/ttyACM0 at 115200bps, this way we can confirm the radio link operates correctly, and after any future changes to the software.

6) upon startup, print streaming timing analysis, and then print SF feasibility analysis
streaming timing analysis (and SF feasibility analysis) example is in file _print_timing.c and it could go into lr20xx_hal/radio_lr20xx.c but modified to run here.  This would likely be called in main() just before AudioLoopback_demo() is called.
